# BANanoKendoUI

## What is BANanoKendoUI?

BANanoKendoUI ist a BANano Wrapper for Kendo UI Core. You can see a demo version here: http://banano.tuebben.de/kendoui/demo/

## What is Kendo UI Core?

Kendo UI is a library that provides some powerful and nicely designed controls. Besides the paid full version there is a free core version which does not include some controls (like the grid, scheduler, charts, etc.).

Here is an overview of the available controls in the core version: https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core

**Please note:**

* Currently the wrapper has the status of a 'proof of concept'.
* Not all controls have been implemented yet.
* The already implemented controls do not yet support all properties and methods.
* The documentation still needs some work.

For this reason only the brave and fearless would be able to work with the library at the moment. ;)
